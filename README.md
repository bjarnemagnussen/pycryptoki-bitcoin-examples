# pycryptoki-bitcoin-examples
Example code snippets for Bitcoin using SafeNet's PKCS11 library implementation pycryptoki.

These are just small code sippets outlining a rough sketch of how pycryptoki can be used with Bitcoin use-cases in mind. They may contain errors and security issues! I have simply written them down while experimenting with Gemalto's Safenet HSM OnDemand.
